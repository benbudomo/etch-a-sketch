# Etch-A-Sketch

In this project, I will be creating a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## Information and Goals

* Create a webpage with 16x16 grid of square divs (These will be made with JavaScript)

* There are several ways to make the divs appear as a grid such as float/clear, inline-block, flexbox, and CSS Grid. Be careful with borders and margins

* Incorporate a "hover" effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse cursor passes over the blocks

* Add a button that clears the current grid and send the user a popup message asking how many squares per side to make the new grid

* Use Git and push code to GitHub
